## Introduction

<b>Under Pressure</b> is a 3D task-management game that was built in <b>42-hours</b> for the [University of Rochester's DandyHacks 2024](https://dandyhacks.net/). In the game, you operate a malfunctioning submarine, and must fix different failing components as you try to reach the surface. But watch out - if too many components break you'll sink and be lost at sea forever. 
Don't let the pressure get to you!
